In this little project, Ive written a program involving usage of FSM. As you'all know we have Mealy State and Moore State Machines so, Ive written a Program based on
sequence detector. The sequence detector is going to take inputs serially and if it detects the pattern **11011** its going to output **1** and if it doesnt then its 
going to output **0**. Also Ive considered the possibility of overlapping of bits. 

Here is the timing diagrams of the both State Machine codes.
